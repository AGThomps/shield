# Getting Started

Let's get you set up with Shield

## Download

Download the latest [release]({{ site.baseurl }}/releases/).

## Run

### Option 1: Docker Container

We have not yet published an official docker container

### Option 2: Zip File

Extract the zip file and run the `shield` script located in the `bin` directory

### Option 3: Run the JAR File

You can run the jar file directly

## Customize

Configure your Shield instance by providing an `application.conf` file.  This is a [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) file, and can also be used to configure the underlying Spray and Akka libraries.
